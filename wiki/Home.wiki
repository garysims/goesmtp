#summary A multi-node ESMTP server written on Go.

= Introduction =

Goesmtp is EXPERIMENTAL and is not yet ready for beta testing or for production deployment.

Goesmtp is a multi-node ESMTP server written on Go. Designed from the ground up to work as a cluster, each node keeps an index of the available messages by using hashes which are distribute throughout the cluster.

If a message is requested (over POP3 only at the moment, no IMAP4) that is not available on the local node, a request is sent to the node with the original message for transmission to the POP3 client.

There is also a rudimentary level of replication and caching for redundancy and to minimize the inter-node traffic.
