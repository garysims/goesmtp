#summary Command line arguments

GoESMTP has some command line arguments which make the server perform certain special tasks. They are:

* forcesync - Empties the current hash table and grabs a current copy from the master node. * Useful when adding a new node to the cluster or repairing a broken node.
purge - deletes everything in the message store and the hash table. Great for testing.
* quickpurge - Same as purge but doesn't empty the message store. Nice and quick.
* createdirs - Create the working directories.
